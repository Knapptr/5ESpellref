# 5eSpellRef

* by Tyler Knapp

#### An small, simple project to practice using:

* React
* The Fetch() API
* Calls to a RESTFUL api
* Bootstrap 4
* Vim(written with)

#### How it Works

Spells are sourced from the DnD5eAPI. After submission, specific information is returned from a second call to the 5e api. If the GIF option is checked- a spell will be accompanied by a _random_ Gif related to the name of the spell. At present, gifs are 3/10 times funny. Usually its fairly unrelated. Hallucinatory terrain and Alter Self usually yield good results.
